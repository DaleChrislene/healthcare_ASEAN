# Problem impact statement
We want to use open data in order to generate an open platform of descriptive analysis of malaria and dengue so that individual non profit organisation may benefit from data sharing and visualisation so that we may help reduce the risk of diseases locally.

# Background
To analyse disease spread in the region, to find out the extent of healthcare available subregion wise, and to find out the shortcomings in present setup.

# Key focus
Is this project related to one of DataKind's key focus areas?
2) Health:- Focus on dengue and malaria, diseases that are spread by mosquitos 
6) ASEAN countries. Firstly focus on Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Philippines. Followed by Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam and Laos.

# Target / Stakeholders
Individual non profit organisations who may not have access/expertise in larger scale data analytics will be able to leverage from our platform.

Reach out to global NGOs such as UN to promote the platform to extend on their Sustainable Development Goals(SDG). Other global organisations identified are Red Cross, ASTMH, WHO and Champs.

# Impact
Promote data sharing on the scale that individual non profit organisations may not have the resources to do so on their own. Probable restructuring of healthcare efforts.
